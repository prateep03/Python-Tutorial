    "Recommender systems are among the most popular applications of data science today. They are used to predict the *rating* or *preference* that an user would give to an item. Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers. YouTube uses recommender systems to decide which video to play next on autoplay.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also popular recommder systems for domains like restaurants and movies. Recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts, collaborators and financial services. YouTube uses the recommendation system at a large scale to suggest videos based on your history."

    "Recommender systems can be classified primarily into 3 types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Simple recommenders</u>: Offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre.  The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. For example, IMDB Top 250.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u> Content-based recommenders</u>: These recommenders suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, actors etc, for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these systems is that if a person likes a particular item, he will also like an item that is similar to it. And to recommend that, it will make use of the user's past item metadata. For example, YouTube, where based on your history, the system suggests new videos that you can potentially watch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u> Collaborative filtering</u>: These systems are widely used, and they try to predict the rating or preference that an user would give an item-based on past ratings and preferences of other  users. Collaborative filtering based recommendation systems do not require item metadata like content-based ones."
